What's new in 0.0.5 (June 4, 2021)
-----------------------------------

.. _whatsnew_005.name_change:

Name change
~~~~~~~~~~~

After bringing in the functionality from ``py-elevation`` 
(:ref:`see below<whatsnew_005.py_elevation>`), a name change was called for.

- The package name on pip is now ``pandas-xyz``
- The package name to import is now ``pandas_xyz``
- The DataFrame accessor is now ``.xyz``


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _whatsnew_005.py_elevation:

Port ``py-elevation`` algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added elevation-related algorithms to package, along with corresponding
DataFrame accessor methods. This functionality was originally found in
another one of my projects called ``py-elevation`` (now deprecated).

Series methods:

- :meth:`DataFrame.xyz.z_filter_threshold`
- :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.xyz.z_smooth_time`
- :meth:`DataFrame.xyz.z_smooth_distance`

.. ipython:: python

  df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
    'elevation': [1.0 * i + np.random.normal() for i in range(30)], 
    'distance': [5.0 * i for i in range(30)]
  })
  
  df['elev_threshold'] = df.xyz.z_filter_threshold()
  df['elev_smooth_t'] = df.xyz.z_smooth_time()
  df['elev_smooth_d'] = df.xyz.z_smooth_distance()
  df[['elevation', 'elev_threshold', 'elev_smooth_t', 'elev_smooth_d']]

Scalar methods:

  - :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.xyz.z_gain_naive`
  - :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.xyz.z_gain_threshold`

.. ipython:: python

  df.xyz.z_gain_naive()
  df.xyz.z_gain_threshold()

Documentation and `README <https://github.com/aaron-schroeder/pandas-xyz/blob/master/README.md>`_
have been updated to explain these new features.
